Prerequisite
------------

Localis uses phpmapscript, an extension to Mapserver, that is documented
	http://mapserver.gis.unm.edu

A solution is to use EasyMapServer, a quick installer to build 
mapserver with php in CGI mode for use with Localis.

You can get EasyMapServer at 
  http://developer.berlios.de/projects/easymapserver


Linux Install
-------------
(check http://sig.cwriter.org/index.php/localis/INSTALL/2.linux)

* Database setup
Setup the mysql database with content of tools/localis_db_0_5.sql
For example, you may type :

mysqladmin -u root create localis
cat tools/localis_db_0_5.sql | mysql -u root localis

* maps setup
The Easymapserver install builds all its context in /usr/local/mapserver.
A sample maps set is provided in mapfr module of localis distribution.
Default location is /usr/local/mapserver/www/localis/mapfr if you change
it, modify localis.conf accordingly.

* web setup
Copy the whole localis/ directory in a web space (default is
/usr/local/mapserver/www/localis/localis) and optinally setup apache
with the following block

<VirtualHost *>
ServerName localis.mydomain.org
DocumentRoot /usr/local/mapserver/www/localis/localis
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/mapserver/cgi-bin/"
Alias "/maps/" "/usr/local/mapserver/www/localis/mapfr/"
AddType application/php-cgi .php
Action application/php-cgi /cgi-bin/php
DirectoryIndex index.php
Options +FollowSymLinks
ErrorLog /var/log/apache/localis-error_log
Customlog /var/log/apache/localis-access_log combined
</VirtualHost>

copy the file etc/localis.conf.dist to etc/localis.conf.
The default values are setup for use with module mapfr released with Localis.
In localis.conf, modify database access and path information (at least).

You should change acces rights of following directories to www-data 
(or apache user) be able to write in:
   mapfr/*
   localis/tmp
   localis/templates

(hrum. yes. a real installer is planned. hope soon, yes.)
