Prerequisite
------------

Localis uses phpmapscript (PHP 4.2.1 with mapserver 3.6) that has 
to be installed.

A solution is to use EasyMapServer, a quick installer to build 
mapserver with php in CGI mode for use with Localis.

You can get EasyMapServer at 
  http://developer.berlios.de/projects/easymapserver


Install
-------
To install Localis, copy the file etc/localis.conf.dist to etc/localis.conf.
The default values are setup for use with module mapfr released with Localis.
In localis.conf, modify database access and path information (at least).

Setup the mysql database with content of mapfr/sql, and put mapfr/ directory 
in a space accessible by web user, change localis.conf accordingly.

Then put the whole localis directory in a web space and browse.

(hrum. yes. a real installer is planned. hope soon, yes.)
