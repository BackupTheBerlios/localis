Prerequisite
------------

Localis uses phpmapscript (PHP 4.2.1 with mapserver 3.6) that has 
to be installed.

A solution is to use EasyMapServer, a quick installer to build 
mapserver with php in CGI mode for use with Localis.

You can get EasyMapServer at 
  http://developer.berlios.de/projects/easymapserver


Install
-------
Setup the mysql database with content of sql/, and put mapfr/ directory 
in a space accessible by web user, change etc/localis.conf accordingly.

Then put the whole localis directory in a web space and browse.
